# Calculator
This project is a simple graphical calculator built in C using the GTK+ library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator is lightweight, responsive, and a great demonstration of integrating C with a modern GUI library.
